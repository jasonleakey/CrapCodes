/**
 * Homework 1 
 * 
 * Design and write a program that recognizes simple date expressions like:
 * “March 15”, “the 22nd of November”, “Christmas”, “Labor Day”. Your program
 * should recognize all such “absolute” dates, but not “deictic” ones relative
 * to current day like “the day before yesterday”. Each edge of the graph should
 * have a word or a set of words on it. Whenever possible use classes of words
 * to avoid having too many arcs (e.g. holidays for Labor Day, Memorial Day,
 * etc).
