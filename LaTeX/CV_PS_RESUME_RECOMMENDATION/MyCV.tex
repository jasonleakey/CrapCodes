    \textsf{Nov. 2010-Now} & \textit{Study of Feature Extraction
    Method for Wrist Pulse}\\
    & \setlength{\parindent}{2em} The subject aims to analyze the
    characteristics of people's wrist pulse 
    information with different health conditions. 
    
    I have spent around one and a half months collecting thousands of
    wrist pulse signals of the healthy, the sub-healthy, diabetic, cardiac and
    patients of other diseases using our independently designed device. 
    Then a database was established on these pulse signals along with
    their verified quantified health reports provided by Guangdong
    hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
    
    Afterwards, preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance signals. According
    to the observation to these human wrist pulse waveforms, several
    features were selected for further recognition. So far, a
    preliminary result of 67\% correctness has been reached and more
    features are desired for better classification. \\[2mm]

    Study on Measuring and Modelling Method of Bidirectional
    Reflectance Distribution Function} \\
    & \setlength{\parindent}{2em} The purpose of this topic is to
    measure certain features of two surface materials in satellites.
    First, I setup an experiment platform to measure the reflected
    light intensity by materials in each angle. Then experimental data
    were fitted by a multinomial model by programming. Finally, the
    accuracy of the obtained model was tested by comparing with the
    factual experiment data.
