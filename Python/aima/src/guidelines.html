<h1>Rationale for the AIMA Python Project</h1>

We already have a body of <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/code/doc/overview.html">existing
Lisp code</a>; why do we need a Python version (especially when the
Lisp version is not yet complete)?  Several reasons:
<ul>
<li> Python has a cross-platform GUI toolkit; Lisp does not.

<li> Python has standard libraries for http, html, xml, regexs,
database integration, persistent storage, interfacing to C, threads,
etc.  Lisp has most of these things in particular implementations, but
they are not standard.  (The Lisp standard was a marvel in 1992, but
it froze then, and other languages have leaped ahead.)

<li> Python is easier to support cross-platform; there is one
standard, free Python implementation that runs on Windows, MacOS,
Linux, and most other Unix versions.  With Lisp, you need to support
several different implementations to hit all the platforms. This has
proven to be a (minor) maintainence problem. (Example: I have a
version of Kyoto Common Lisp from 1983 running on a NeXt cube; how do
I ...)

<li> Of all the established languages in the world, Python is closest
to the pseudo-code that we developed (independently) for the book.

<li> Some people are parenphobic and just don't like Lisp. Some people
find it easier to learn Python than Lisp, and some instructors don't
want to spend the time to introduce a new language to students
(admittedly, this is partly the fault of the authors of AIMA for
producing a 1000 page book). For these people, and for the sake of
variety in general, it's good to have a choice of languages.

<li> See my <a href="http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html">Lisp vs. Python comparison</a> for more rationale on using Python.
</ul>

<h1>AIMA Python Project Goals</h1>

Goals in order of
importance:

<ol>
<li> Identify errors in the book before it is published.
(So need key algorithms coded and tested before August 2002.)
<li> Show how the pseudo-code in the book can be implemented.
   (So be faithful to code in the book.)
<li> Give reader/programmers a playground to experiment with and extend.
   (So add scaffolding and examples and documentation for them to use.)
<li> Give reader/non-programmers informative graphical demos they can 
run and observe.
   (So make nice GUIs and demos that show how algorithms work.) 
</ol>

<h1>Not goals</h1>

Don't worry about the following:

<ul>
<li> Efficient code for solving practical AI problems. If they want
efficiency, they'll recode the algorithms in C or whatever.  The goal
is to give them the basic algorithms to start from if they want to
code something more efficient.  However, sometimes the boundary
between "more efficient" and "different algorithm" is fuzzy.  For
example, I implement the search algorithms with a Priority Queue,
(with O(log n) insert time) because a linear list (with O(n) time)
would be <i>too</i> inefficient.  

<li> Compatibility with the <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/code/doc/overview.html">existing
Lisp code</a>.  Most students will look at one language only, so
compatibility is irrelevent.  By all means, look at the Lisp code to
get ideas, but don't worry about naming, coding, or other conventions.
Also, I now believe that the Lisp code is too dense and abstract;
experienced Lispers appreciate it, but novices are confused.  Keep it
simple!
</ul>

<h1>Coding and Style Conventions</h1>

It will probably be summer 2002 when this is released, so it is
safe (and encouraged) to use Python 2.2 features like nested scope,
list comprehensions, generators and iterators (including "x in
dictionary").

I want the file structure to be not-too-confusing, so I'm leaning
towards a single flat directory, with most files around 300 lines, but
some 600 or even 1000 (much like the Python libraries).  There will be
at most one file per Chapter, and sometimes one file for several
chapters: agents.py (Chapter 2), search.py (Chapters 3-4),
etc. Possibly the GUI components will be in separate files
(agents-gui.py, search-gui.py, etc.).

<p>In general, follow <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html">Guido's style
conventions</a>.  I released a version that deviated from the
guidelines (I had 2 spaces per indent, and <tt>_</tt> instead of
<tt>self</tt> in methods), and was <strike>quickly shot down</strike>
politely asked to change by <a
href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-January/019634.html">python-dev</a>. I agreed with their suggestions, so now we're left with:

<ul>
<li> Use <tt>#___________</tt> (out to 79 spaces) to delimit code sections.
This gets changed to <tt>"&lt;hr&gt;"</tt> by my <a href="py2html.html">py2html</a> module.
<li>Don't bother with the blank line after the first line of a multi-line 
docstring, except for module docstrings.
<li> Use executable examples in doc strings and in the <tt>_docex</tt>
module variable, as defined in my <a href="docex.html">docex</a> module.
(I know that docex is very similar to Tim Peters' 
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html">doctest</a>;
for some reason I missed noticing his module (which appeared in Python 2.1) 
until I had finished mine.  His does much more, but I like mine fine
for my very limited purposes so I haven't switched.)
<li>Naming conventions:
  <ul>
        <li>modulenames: lowercase
        <li>ClassNames: CapWords
        <li>ExceptionNames: CapWords
        <li>function_names: lower_underscores, except FactoryFunctions
        <li>global_variable_names: lower_underscores
        <li>method_names: lower_underscores
        <li>local_variable_names: lower_underscores
</ul></ul>

<h1>Scope</h1>

What programs do we need?  

<ul>
<li> All the algorithms from the figures (except some that are
<i>really</i> vague pseudo-code).  Each such class/function should
have "[Fig. <i>nn.nn</i>]" at the end of the doc string. A good thing
to do is go through page by page and try to transliterate, and when
there are issues that are not automatically translatable, stop and
think.

<li> Some algorithms that are not in the book as figures, but are
alluded to (such as a FOPC theorem prover).  See the <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/code/doc/overview.html">existing
Lisp code</a> for examples of this.


<li>A GUI framework.  Probably in Tkinter.  In order of importance, 
the following types of windows should be considered:
<ul>
<li> A 2-d discrete grid environment window, with a simple way to edit the
environment (maybe click on a square brings up a menu of objects that
can be placed there or deleted from there), and buttons for "run
single step", "run n steps", and "stop", and output for the agents'
scores.

<li> A graph drawing window that can be hooked up to the search code.
There most be existing modules for this.  The idea is to let the user
see the search tree/graph for a problem as an animation, and see how
it varies for different search algorithms.  

<li> A statistics window for monitoring experiments.  The idea is you
attach a statistics monitoring tool to a variable of some kind (the
score of an agent, the number of iterations an algorithm needs, etc.) 
and graph values of the variables in real time as the experiment(s) run.

<li> A 2-d continuous environment where objects and agents are
displayed as shapes that can move around. Similar to the grid
environment.

<li> A master window that lists all the modules, and allows the reader
to load them and run their interactive testing/example suites.  

<li> Various other windows for various applications.
</ul>
</ul>

The trickiest part about this is that we want a way to attach GUIs to
code without making the code ugly.  So the code should be able to run
stand-alone, and use some kind of notification protocol to a GUI 
that may or may not be running.  You gotta love <a
href="http://www.vpython.org">VPython</a>, an environment for doing 3D
physics simulations.  There, all you do is create objects like "ball =
Sphere()", and modify them like "ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity *
dt".  The way it works is that a separate thread runs the display
window, and when any VPython object is created it gets registered with
the latest display window (a compromise: makes it harder to do
multiple windows, but the resulting simplisity is worth it), and the
display window's thread monitors all its objects for change in
position, color, size, etc.  I don't think we want to use VPython per
se, but we should steal their approach.  For 2D grid environments, its
easy: we launch a separate thread that monitors all the objects in the
enviornment (which we keep track of), and updates the display as
necessary.  So really there's only one line of code in the Environment
class that has to know about the possibility of displays.
<p>
Let's also look at DDD, GVD, TiX, IDE Studio, PyDoc, and surely other projects.
